# Holiday Over

as the bus resumes its affair with the quiet highway  
I wave to her glowing features  
those hopeful eyes poised to  
flood my brain with strange demands  
(yet she agreed  
this holiday consumes money like a tiger)  
   
she ignites her return  
to the lakeside retreat where summer memories reside  
while the bus penetrates the winding darkness  
I settle into the moon-drenched seat  
her flavours play on my lips  
the sweet glue left to remind me  
she clasps me to her nakedness beside the dawn  
in the crisp linen of her dreams  
   
signs to Melbourne slip by  
their fluorescent numbers  
bounce off my cradle of fantasies  
   
__coral shimmers in her hand melting my secrets_  
__ looks accuse_  
__muslin dress drips onto cinnamon sand_  
__I profess everything as the sky licks her belly_  
__we steal each other to the room to pull lips to rub hairs to melt flesh into the night_  
   
a trace of her remains  
on my tongue as sleep spreads open  
a gloomy morning hugging the suburbs  
soon this holiday terminates  
but naked images brush the edges while  
her smile drives her confession through the  
clouds like a note discovered in my pocket.
