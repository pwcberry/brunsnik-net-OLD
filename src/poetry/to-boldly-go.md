# To boldly go

Why as a society  
Do we not feel the same excitement  
About space science  
As we do about football?  

I’m not knocking football, really,  
I’m a dedicated Essendon supporter;  
But I’m also a nerd.  

There is much happening in the   
Exploration of the solar system,  
But it’s rarely in the mainstream of news.  

It should be!  
We’ve visited the extremes of the solar system,  
Touched comets and asteroids  
To understand our origins.  

We are crawling along Martian craters  
Scanning for water;  
We are zooming above Jupiter’s boisterous clouds.  

Nasa’s Twitter feed should be  
The most followed and retweeted,  
Facebook should be thick with photos  
From the reaches of space,  
Rather than regurgitated memes.  

We should be a generation of space farers,  
Inspired by the people  
Who design and build the components and engines  
For the assembly into craft We ride beyond our atmosphere  
To bring our imaginations  
Closer to the beauties and mysteries  
Of our solar system.
