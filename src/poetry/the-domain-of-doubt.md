# The Domain of Doubt

wandering  
along the luminous parades where princesses preside with numb glamour  
through gloomy galleries where doors ache with the comedy of fear  
outside mighty arenas where men evoke the colours of loyalty  
near cosmic theatres where oracles dispense chemical rhythms  
   
I allow the proud lethargy  
to litter my pockets with excuses  
like a spectator without method  
and my mouth bursts into subdued slogans that twist away inside the glassy breeze  
   
fantasy and shame  
are extracted at whim like beer or scotch  
in this grungy bar  
where I linger in vapours of hope  
   
wondering at the burning curves  
clad in feminine shades of strength  
and their ripening smiles  
drift through the midnight haze  
touching the drinks of chance  
they flash names like Ecstasy and Heartache  
along the course of moods  
while I consider the bets for favourable lips  
those glistening to the taste of music  
   
I move  
the noise of booze staggers the field  
the odds of desire suddenly cryptic  
the grapes of her face tickle my memory  
   
_ah_  
_inarticulate feet_  
_map my indecent guilt_  
   
wandering  
beneath the sky festering with cat’s eyes  
I appeal to the blood-rich trees  
secure the rain’s honour!  
foster the moon’s humour!  
reverse the earth’s costume!  
exploit the sun’s fortune!  
wrench me from this frothy state  
immerse me in the treasure of desire  
punch me with golden directions  
ignite me on the majesty of language  
   
but the voiceless answer  
opens a peacock’s tail of question marks  
a dance for my inert hands  
to worship the spring of disorder  
as the wooden gurus beat their riddles  
   
wandering  
here the fermented poster of paradise  
here the warnings of true tenderness  
here pieces of the tormented dream  
sensations like cinema in this cold arcade  
   
wandering  
streets shout  
comrades rally their smashed hero  
women of tireless nobility  
her moist tones float like a spent echo  
  
_as around me_  
_day breaks suspiciously_  
_like instant love_  
   
I bargain with the concrete morning  
while passengers on their fare to fame taxi by through the tailings of night  
   
a grandiose sigh  
crystal spores erupt from my lungs  
and a weary passage home appears  
as I penetrate the daylight  
loaded with the vagrant hopes of an  
urban prophet
