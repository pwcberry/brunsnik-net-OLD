# On this day bulging with sunshine

Brain’s out-of-sync with the fresh photons  
bouncing through the kitchen  
with a smell of molten butter  
   
skipping along my shirt reaching for the mat.  
   
Vitamins drop from the cupboard with crackers  
loud rattle in the hazardous silence while she enjoys precious sleep,  
my eyes yet to pull my hands into focus -  
potential for a trend  
   
on a day bulging with sunshine.  
   
Humidity restricts my collar and smears my paper  
no sprint in my legs and the crush sweeps me aboard the  
jungle train where I accidentally scrape shins caught in the multiped shuffle.  
   
At the shop  
spare change was drunk last night  
my tenuous slice of credit  
spans the chasm to coffee numero uno  
to prepare for the unanswered emails that lurk like  
mosquitos around my desk  
and the day bulges with sunshine.  
   
Frustration buzzes thoughts down leafy avenues to  
empty addresses overshadowed by holiday posters  
in this derelict mental suburb  
that eats my lunch hour  
on this day bulging with sunshine.  
   
Later I grope for repartee  
while my colleagues spin various humours  
on a swelling bar tab  
   
quietly with a forewarning  
unseen  
my corporate tie accepts the sauce  
specially for this shindig  
   
and when I yearn for foreign plums on my lips  
I stumble into this evening with  
neon pockets bulging with eyes  
awaiting  
the first apple in conversation.
