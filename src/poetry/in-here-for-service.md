# In Here For Service


Morning slaps me awake and I embark on another day,  
the shower rinses away the weekend twice,  
breakfast is a blur of toast and juice,  
and the tram won’t pardon my tardy shoes –   
my employer never hurries.  

I equip my humaneness in the armour of irony  
and drift into the corporate glasshouse  
mingling with those who nurture the company’s slogan like an illness,  
before the lift swallows us  
and spews me onto the routine floor.  

Another shift to scratch through to the afternoon,  
clocks spit time from all angles,  
I socialize a path to my dormant terminal,  
supervisors lurk among their paperwork   
sensing my errant arrival –  
I greet them with a sneaking  joke  
and this excuse fades on their lips as I settle my arse.  

In this systematic environment  
where my employer’s goals shape the foliage  
into the words it recommends,  
a swarm of voices  
attends on customers  
who anticipate flowering service  
as their enquiries sprout through the fertile phone-lines.  

But telecommunications displace reality,  
boredom infests the atmosphere,  
my imagination despatches postcards from elsewhere,  
as callers burden my ears with requests, grievances, and disasters.  
I maintain my charming indifference,  
I urge the minutes to spin me into freedom,  
I hear those sweet dollars tick over.   

so many  
unaware of this company’s manipulation  
to fatten its shareholders  

so many  
blind to the issues of fine print  

so many  
assume this company offers solutions they can drink  

when in a cinematic moment  
my hand drives through the phone-lines  
and clutches their necks  
to shake them until common sense appears –  
yet faith in illusion   
wilts after I taste true humanity.  

Ah, to escape this employer –  
the mere thought is joy.  
But with the lack of professional marks  
and drawing from my resources as an artist,  
respectable income kisses me like a reward  

when  
emptiness and tedium diminish while  
I’m lost in a smoking lull  

when  
sections of my brain ask:  
‘What? Are we meant to be working?’  

when  
I am a vague entity  
in a world where the lust for profit  
fosters a strange philosophy:  
as a shit-kicker I must earn my lifestyle  
like an insect
