# Untouchable

when we converse  
your voice is like smoke carved from the night sky  
saturated in the syrup of knowledge  
we indulge in  
out of sync with my desolate musing  
as humour deflects the chill that besieges us  
   
when my eyes contact yours like predators  
through the undergrowth of doubt flourishing in this room  
my yearning feeds on your mystique  
and the rain continues.  
   
after weeks that smouldered  
as we probed the obscure reach of friendship  
during our liquid truce  
candles spray a layer of seduction  
over the crisis in your face  
sensations too distant to acquire  
   
glimmers of melody  
breakout across my inner ear  
an infection attuned to the  
transmission encoded in our dark gaze  
and the rain continues.  
   
even when you are invisible  
I suspect the catastrophe in lovely dimensions  
will germinate  
when I play your mouth  
drink your figure  
search the deep language of your heat  
while winter dissolves  
and the rain overruns my footsteps.
