# Sydney

Aware of your A-list properties  
this splendid maritime figure  
fitting urban couture  
you grace this continent and the world  
with your harbours and beach-proof style
 
Addicted to celebrity and pyrotechnic highs  
dedicated to festivals of sensuality  
(daily tastings if you could)  
you kissed me by the quay  
near The Coathanger hooked into the  
blues of a Whiteley canvas stretched  
over sand, sails and swimsuit snobbery
 
_This I farewell_
 
6.47am the taxi manoeuvres through bridge traffic  
while a coda for my sojourn plays:  
the sun pokes between the heads  
caresses the hills and coves like breasts and thighs  
in soft yellow strokes through wisps of rain  
drifting over the early watercraft

such serenity in this vivacious metropolis  
seizes and squeezes my  
Antipodean heart  
as fate drives me onto the Eastern Distributor toward London
 
Sydney  
like my lover  
lying sunlit on sheets of blue gazing at me

Beauty  
to remind me of home
