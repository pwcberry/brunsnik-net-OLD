# Begin with the grandeur

Begin with the grandeur  
the luxurious documentary contrives  
when I share my spoils from love, laughter and dismay  
with a world hungry for glamour  
inside this dream thrust into the dawn,  
a cosy dream the sun strokes  
with each tempting finger,  
before the grimy morning slices open this fresco  
and vomits the stale fruit of the new pop models  
from a million ears  
across the hazy words  
I bled in drops onto this page while the night lived.  
Now smoke drifts from my scowl  
as a fresh lament builds inside me like breakfast.  

Touch the grandeur  
immortalised in concrete, in posters, in lively books,  
or sitting in a café on the cobbled square  
with my non-chalant comrades of glamour  
the dream tourists admire,  
before the eclipse  
when elegance trespasses the calm afternoon  
as the skeletons jangle the hour,  
breasts and legs in the shadow of a fey smile  
as she navigates each table like a butterfly;  
suddenly the unfamiliar sunlight evaporates these absinthe visions  
I retreat to my verbal fortification  
bristling with a reputation unpublished in this bar’s chatter,  
when the manifestation arrives to deposit her flyer.  
My sensual flag flies up,  
she glows in sultry code,  
already a matter of publicity.  
   
The evening flirts with grandeur  
raised from the frenzy of language  
torn from the literature of sex  
full of captured fantasies still shaking with glitter  
while the sumptuous sunset remains to stain the air,  
she watches her reflection like a stranger  
where the phantoms’ dance enters the night  
to collect the dreams I hammer out  
in another struggle for words  
to describe the perfume  
leaking from her sensuous tears drawn from sunshine  
that flickers through the windows of failure.
