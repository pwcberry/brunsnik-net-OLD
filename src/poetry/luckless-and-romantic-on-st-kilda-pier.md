# Luckless and Romantic on St Kilda Pier

Sunset folds into dusk  
azure pursues the daily flame beyond the horizon  
growing tangerine feathers and crimson tails  
that linger  
above the motorised creatures  
as they crawl or sprint along geometrical black scars  
in the direction of dinner  
   
From this pier attached to popular paths  
the backdrop of thrusting architecture  
dissolves inside the package of darkness  
as the first eyes sparkle  
   
Dropping here  
locked in my self-crisis  
this setting touches me with hints of revival  
in the divine foreplay of the sun’s recess  
   
And at this pier splashed with romance  
warped breezes soak the well-wishers  
who stroll the edge  
their loving moment gone in daylight’s wrap up  
   
I cast one  
then another  
stone of money into the waves clawing this breakwater  
my loneliness sucked down into water polluted with dreams  
   
Away from the view  
couples linked  
unlinked  
deep in rapture  
stained with sunset refreshments  
smile heavy with life’s silver  
in a slow breath on shore again  
   
And my odyssey continues  
along the obscure route to my ultimate muse  
   
Embraced by night  
darlings travel to pockets upholstered with ardent sighs  
that burn like my mistakes  
as I meander under love’s canopy  
deaf to the bright steady clock made ugly by desire  
but these beauties soar in search of favourable constellations  
that I gaze at like a baffled adventurer
