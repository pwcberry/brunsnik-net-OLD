# Dead Spider Zone

dead spider zone  
in here  
silent warning for those who breach  
the comfort perimeter  
   
eight-legged terror  
stay beyond these magnolia walls  
do not disturb my TV trance  
as your entry into my sight  
   
is a future submerged in neurotoxins  
and your aggressive reaction gives you  
another coating  
into which you shrink  
those spasms time your demise  
   
dead spider zone  
you dare to lightly march over  
recent carcasses up to the window sill  
sneak through cracks or along drains  
to begin a vain search through my rooms  
   
stay in your realms  
feast on the small residents among bushes and dried foliage  
grab the flying visitors to this garden lounge  
tune your silk arrays to catch sport  
   
keep you dreadful presence  
where its prickly purpose is best:  
to terrorize the pests near my herbs  
out of my space  
   
dead spider zone  
legs twitch from  
a neurotoxin jacket  
until my breath  
settles.
