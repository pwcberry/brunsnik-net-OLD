# Friends for the night

swept up in the rhythms  
of people around us  
we introduce ourselves  
friends for the night  

we share what's close to heart  
as hours pass quickly with smiles  
in the comfort of knowledge  
we join hands as we rise with the music  
friends for the night  

sunrise over the bridge  
as we walk in a happy fog  
light-footed we jump on the bus  
we part before the magic fades  
friends for the night
