# What I need to hear

What I need to hear while  
under this refreshing shower  
is the melody for that song  
people will remember years later -  

how that song defined an  
event or season in their lives.  

That melody is locked up  
in between my ears,  
somewhere.  

_(This shower reanimates my thoughts.
Splish, splosh.)_

Late at night, rent paid for  
after cold-calling residences for surveys,  
I smoke weed and drink beer  
to loosen the brain tissue,  
then scrawl lines or feel guitar chords  
to record whatever escapes.  

Songcraft requires persistence and patience,  
a reassurance the band  
only sees as nonsense finally  
tossed into the musical trash.  

_(Soon the shower's coda glides down my skin.
Drip, drop, dop. Da dee-dee du dummm...)_

Flushed, I exit the bathroom,  
pass the TV commune  
to where my guitar waits by the futon.  
I reach for it,  
buzzing with a tune.
